SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"This is a 1-year review (purchased 2021).For what it is, it's just the normal flagship galaxy that folds and has a notification screen in the front. For that, its a great phone. But the technology is too new and i have no idea how the screen will fair in the future.I haven't experienced any problems with the screen itself yet, but the protector, which they say specifically not to touch, broke after about a month, just from folding the phone. It left a huge scratch line across the fold itself. I thought the screen itself was ruined until I took it off. Do yourself a favor and remove the protector, no protector can handle being folded as many times as you'll fold it, trust me.Photos are great, screen is great. ..I mean it's literally a galaxy that folds.. so just keep that in mind. It's worth noting I literally bought this phone as a joke because I thought it would be funny to have a flip phone and all my friends making fun of me, but it's been quite the opposite. Everyone wants to screw around with your phone and thinks it's cool, lol.Until this screen proves itself, I don't recommend it to anyone who can only afford a phone every few years. If you want it just for fun and don't care about what could go wrong in the future like myself, go ahead and buy it, I enjoy it."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"So far, I've been impressed with the durability (looks as good as it did when I got it 3 months ago)."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Completely stopped working. I wouldn't suggest buying any fold or flip products for years. There technology is not ready and everyone I know including myself has had the same problems and get stuck with a useless phone. Such as waste of money. I even tried to send it in to be fix the bill was $400, $300 was just to get it fixed. We asked for it to be sent back to use and we found it working even less"
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Hay que destacar primero que es un tel√©fono de muy alta calidad en cuanto a especificaciones y a la est√©tica del dispositivo en su construcci√≥n, as√≠ como Samsung ya nos tiene acostumbrados.Pero sin embargo tiene dos puntos en los cuales me decepcion√≥ mucho y me decant√© por venderlo a las 2 semanas de haberlo comprado, y estos son:La bater√≠a: Realmente es una verg√ºenza que Samsung nos traiga un dispositivo que dure tan poquito en cuanto a la bater√≠a. Realmente no llegaba a la noche nunca, lo ten√≠a que cargar incluso m√°s de una vez durante el d√≠a. Y si comenzamos a ver videos de TikTok o algo similar‚Ä¶ olv√≠dalo.El sistema plegable: Esto quiz√°s es algo propio mio y al mismo tiempo algo que ya era l√≥gico. pero que realmente me molesto siempre. Me resulta muy molesto tener que leer una notificaci√≥n en este tel√©fono. El hecho de que cuando te llegue una notificaci√≥n tengas que tocar dos veces la pantalla peque√±a o tocar el bot√≥n de desbloqueo, y luego deslizar hacia la izquierda es s√∫per s√∫per molesto. Y esa fue otra de las principales razones por las cuales lo termin√© vendiendo y volviendo a iPhone."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Para aquellos que formamos parte de la generaci√≥n X los tel√©fonos celulares plegables, no son una novedad, Motorola nos inund√≥ un mercado de tel√©fonos plegables llegando a ser ""lo mas buscado"" en nuestra juventud. Con la llegada de los Smart Phones los tel√©fonos plegables pasaron a ser un ""dinosaurio"" casi extinto, pues Samsung se encargo de resucitarlos al combinar la ""inteligencia"" de los celulares de hoy con la comodidad de hacerlo plegable ya con su generaci√≥n numero 4 en el mercado sin duda el tel√©fono es lo mejor de los dos mundos, cabe en un bolsillo sin comprometer nuestra comodidad y elegancia, y a su vez lleva toda la potencia (gracias a su procesador Smartdragon) necesaria para manejar al App mas comunes y demandantes de recursos de nuestros dias. El √∫nico punto negativo de FLIP 3 es la corta duraci√≥n de su bater√≠a, problema ya resuelto en el FLIP 4. Si la idea es salir del entorno iOS (iPhone) el Samsung Flip es una excelente elecci√≥n"
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,GLAD there's better alternatives to iphones
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,Don‚Äôt like anything about phone. Any $900 phone should last for more than 3 weeks!
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I like it a lot, but the battery life is killer."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I love this phone, but the two problems I have with it are battery life and durability. I use the phone for just a short time, and I need to put it on the charger. Samsung's next flip needs to have a longer battery life, also it is not very durable. I dropped the phone on floor that had a rug and now there is a crack where the fold is and now when I open and close the phone I hear a cracking sound, but the phone seems to be working properly. I know I could probably get it fixed but it would probably cost as much as the phone"
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,No me agrado q no ven√≠an los aud√≠fonos q supuestamente estaban incluidos en el pedido del tel√©fono....eso se llama fraudeüò†üò†üò†üò†
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Purchased October 2021 and screen began to lift and ""crackling"" noise when closing at month 9. I will never buy a flip phone again."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I believe this design is the future. Big phones becoming fold-able will keep them conveniently usable. The battery does drain more than say the S21+ but not of concern to light or medium user. I consider myself a light user and so battery life is not significant to me. I assume at some point in the future they will make the front screen larger (when folded). Otherwise, except for battery that could be an issue for some, the phone looks good and performs good. Of course, the phone is easy to carry in pocket or purse."

SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Beware!  Does not come with everything that is listed in the What's in the Box list!The What's in the Box portion of the description reads:Handset + ClingSTD BatteryTravel AdapterData CableAKG HeadsetIt did NOT come with a travel adapter or AKG Headset.  When looking other places, I saw where the phone normally doesn't come with those either.  But I thought maybe I was getting a bundle.  Please change your description to the correct information as to not give false information to paying customers."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I was a little nervous about the durability of this phone, but so far I'm very glad that I bought it."

SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,Purchased a year ago. A few days ago the seam broke in the middle right at the hinge and is getting longer every day.  Disappointed.....
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"The phone form factor is great, and that's the ONLY good thing. Battery life stinks, not all apps display correctly on the long thin screen, the cameras are MEH at this price point, and the REQUIRED screen protector started separating from the display after a couple of months, right at the seam. AT&T not interested in fixing it and 'damage during removal voids warranty' so if I try fixing it and damage the screen, I'm out of $1k. My first and last experiment with a folding phone by Samsung. Not remotely ready for prime time."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,I got this as an Anniversary gift for my wife. She loves it. She is constantly showing it off to her friends. The phone has so many features. Beautiful and functional.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I purchased 3 of these phones from Verizon on a 2 year plan. 2 of the 3 phones have the ""built in screen protector"" coming off staring from the fold in the middle. I am so disappointed in samsung as a company for even selling these. I have only had these phones 6 months. Also it's very hard to find cases that allow the phone to open all the way. There is a reason the phone companies are selling these phones so cheap now. Now, if I want new phones I am stuck in a contract for another year and a half with these. Verizon and Samsung are no help. The screen repair place says the distributor is all out of the screen protectors. If I take it off myself, it will damage the screen. You can't just use a regular screen protector in it. Anyway, the folding aspect of it is NOT worth the hassle of having this broken phone now. Just go with a bar shaped phone. You won't regret it."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I got this as a 2nd phone....my primary is Fold 2...I love the size, clear screen."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I love this phone because it's easy to put in your pocket BUT I'm starting to have issues with the screen and just had to get a warranty replacement.  There are pixels going out causing dots on the screen.  The WORST part, which I was concerned about in the beginning, is there is now a wrinkle/crease in the middle where it closes.  I hope this isn't an issue again.  I've had the phone 5 months."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I was looking for a small phone I could put in my pocket. New phones are so big and my phone isn't my life. Unfortunately all small phones are missing a lot of new improvements. Samsung normally puts do much junk on the phone and have a bad UI. I decided that having it golf so I could put it in my pocket and still sit down.I am surprised how much they have improved the UI and how smooth it has ran so far. It fits great in my pocket but it feels fragile and the outside is glass. I put a cover on it and it seems more sturdy.Battery life could be better, I really don't use my phone a lot but I do find I am close to 20 percent at bed time. My pixel I was around 50 percent at bed time.If you want a phone that fits in your pocket and has all the cool tech this is it! I thought I would be writing an average rating on this but the more I use it the more I like it!"
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,Don't buy this phone!  LCD split and failed at fold crease.  Samsung has it right now and won't pay for warranty repair on a 6 month old phone.  Battery life was also terrible.  Will never buy another Samsung product.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,Phone isn't even 5 months old and will power off when it isnt kept fully opened.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"The phone is broken.  The screen froze and then a black smear appeared just above the fold line.  I've only had the phone four months.  This, after having replaced the FIRST phone which had poor reception."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,The phone is pretty good. I gave 2 stars because the box does not contain a) A CHARGER b) EARPHONES as otherwise stated on the product page!!! Very misleading... I usually prefer /use chargers that come with electronic devices. The box clearly says charger is included so confused and sad.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"This phone is everything, thanks."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I hardly ever used my old smartphone outside my house because it was too big for any pocket. But I wanted a phone with me at all times to make calls and access the Internet in emergencies. Typing on my old flip (lower case f, not the first Flip) phone was too cumbersome, especially if time is of the essence. I bought the Flip 3 for one reason and one reason only - to have a phone which fit in my pocket. And that's it's only selling point. It's the first expensive phone I've ever purchased, and it doesn't do anything better than my old $100 Nokia phone, which had a headphone jack, removeable battery, expandable storage, and dual SIMs. I stupidly bought the 128GB version and there's only 72% of that available to me, for my apps and data, AFTER deleting all the junk I could. It's also pretty heavy, and I wouldn't trust it in a lightweight mesh pocket. I don't recommend it and may return it. I feel I should have bought something else, and maybe in another few years there will be a better pocket-sized option. Please, NOKIA, help me out here..."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,This has been nagging at me! I bought a $1000 gift for my daughter‚Äôs wedding that is a brick now.¬†They got about 60 days of use before it stopped & melted down while sitting on table. (this just happed; the phone was not in use or damaged in any way)Likely you have heard that before. There are 100‚Äôs of posts/articles that say the same thing & don‚Äôt buy this phone‚Ä¶Sent to Samsung repair‚Ä¶ After it came back from the repair people it does not light up anymore.¬†When shipped; the screen would light up but at the fold it appeared that liquid had oozed out.¬†It was not possible to see or read anything on either screen but it was clearly powered up & seemed to be taking commands.When it came back from the repair there was no explanation of any kind. Why it was back? What was wrong? Why it does not turn on any more? No options were offered?Since then; I have been completely left without recourse or anyone willing to talk about it. Highly upsetting‚Ä¶I am a phone sales & minor repair rep for a living. I have recommended or sold 10‚Äôs of thousands of Samsung phones or products over the last 6 years. Until this myself & family swore by Samsung Products.This has ended that completely. Now I have a goal for next year to stop completely sales or persuade anyone coming in for Samsung to seriously consider any other option I can present a case for.I will be doing anything that I can to get even‚Ä¶ My daughter is an attorney in New York State & she feels we will win hands down in Small Claims court in a few weeks. However I‚Äôm disappointed to see no ‚ÄúClass Action Suit‚Äù started. Hopefully soon.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I bought this phone thinking it would replace my I phone. Now I have to be tethered to a charging source because the Samsung Flip Z3 battery is probably the worst phone battery on the market. With 10 minutes of use the battery drained down to 72% . What a bargain, $999 for a phone that will run out of battery life quicker than you can say flip z3. Flip for another phone."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,One day after the return window closed I discovered a bright spot on display screen. Researched it and apparently it's a bad pixel which is a factory defect and cannot be repaired. Can you guess how happy I am?
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,My only complaint is the short life on the battery.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,Still figuring out all the features but light and durable
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"*Pros*The interface is very smooth and quick. The flip function makes it easier to handle this device and fit in pockets & purse. And lastly, the camera's quality isn't the worst.*Cons*Very expensive price tag for those on a fixed budget. Not the most impressive battery life. The double tap on & off feature has gotten annoying at times.-- Make your own decision whether or not to purchase the $1000 product. Do not purely base your purchase on my or any review. It's your money, do whatever you want with it. --"
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,And dont expect Amazon to help .
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,Eveything about this phone is super cool. I needed a new one for a while and decided to get the Z Flip 3. No regrets here! My favorite feature is the cover display and would love it even if this phone doesn't flip closed. The only drawback is the battery but I work from home so it isn't a big deal for me.
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,I've only had this for a few days but I'm very happy with it.  I read the reviews before buying and was extremely concerned with the fingerprint feature. I don't know what people are complaining about.  It's the best fingerprint option I've ever had.  It's actually on the side of the phone where you turn it on.  The button is the fingerprint pad.  It's awesome and turns the phone on when you hit the power button!  Very efficient. I'll update if I run into problems but I'm loving it right now!!
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"(SEE UPDATE BELOW) I love cool stuff and gadgety stuff so this phone was right up my alley. You can feel the bump in the middle of the screen a little but it's not distracting in any way and I sort of like the way it feels and you can only see it if the light hits it a certain way which is not very often. I'm coming off on a 2015 Samsung Note5 so the battery life isn't an issue for me b/c I had to charge mine old one 3 times a day, this battery makes it through the entire day but I really don't do much on it during the day as I am working. I did play the radio on it off and on most of the workday and was very low by mid-evening. I DO miss my Note features/stylist and creating a quick note.  So, over all I have no complaints about this phone, super easy to drop in a pocket and go.UPDATE:  My Z flip 3 will be one year old in about a month. The screen protector has cracked at the fold. With any other phone this would not be a problem and under my warranty Samsung has to replace it, here is the issue; Under the warranty I should be able to walk into any of my 5 local service centers and have the screen protector replaced, and only ONE time under warranty, however, it takes a special machine to put this screen protector on and Samsung has not sent the machines to ANY (I'd be willing to drive 50 miles) of the service centers near me. What this means for me is that I have to send my phone into Samsung and for God knows how long, I'm guessing about 7 days. As far as I'm concerned, this is unacceptable and Samsung needs to get those machines out to all the service centers. I also have to say that the screen protector that comes with it gets very smudgy and you just really can't ever keep it clean, I mean you can wipe it clean and then the next time you handle it it's all smudged up again, this is sort of getting on my nerves now, and I'm always embarrassed to hand my phone to somebody to look at it or my pictures. In addition to that I've also noticed that my battery seems to be getting increasingly weaker, I hope that's not just my imagination, but I am charging it up At least once around 2pm during my work day. Now, all that being said, Samsung came out with a new Z flip 4 and they had a deal, if you want to call it that, because I don't think it's that great of a deal, but for $300, I was able to trade in my Z flip 3 (They will take a cracked screen protector just not a cracked screen on a trade in) for a new Z flip 4 (Gluten for punishment) which is supposed to have a bigger battery and I'm hoping they upgraded the Protector, I don't know but that's how bad I didn't want to send my phone in and be without it. So I guess I don't dislike the phone enough to abandon the Z flip model altogether YET. However, if you think about it, if the screen protector cracks every 11 months, then where does that leave you? I'll tell you where it leaves you, it leaves you having to buy their warranty for $300. Now I haven't seen the warranty and how many cracked screen protectors it will cover but I'm assuming it would cover all of them.  So let me say this, if the screen protector cracks again and they still don't have the machines to replace them, I will not buy this model anymore till they work out their issues."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"My wife and I each bought one of these phones in September 2021.  3 months later, her screen factures and splits right at the bend while its sitting on the charger.  Not from dropping it, or hitting the screen, or anything she did... it was literally sitting on the charger!  Verizon was completely unwilling to help unless we paid them a $250 deductible... on something still under warranty!  So, we called Samsung and they said they won't cover it under warranty unless they get to examine it, and that will take 2 weeks.  The Verizon rep can clearly see that the screen is fractured along the bend where the screen folds, but the Samsung rep refused to accept that.  And then the Samsung rep says that they don't cover this screen under the warranty because of potential for something like this to happen with a foldable screen!  Are you kidding me?!?  You won't warranty your own technology because you know its not reliable?!?  My wife convinced me to move from Apple to Android a few years ago, and specifically to a Samsung phone, but after this we are both going back to Apply products... if I have to pay a fortune for a phone, at least Apple will stand behind their own products."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Skeptical of the quality over time, bought this to test it.  The hardware so far is rock solid, phone is of exceptional build quality.  The screen fold is hardly noticeable, the hinge feels firm when opening and closing, the sound is decent, the camera is great, and it fits in my pocket!However once you open up the flip, what's on the screen just ruins the whole experience.  Samsung's One UI they created is as bad as getting a phone from your carrier, loaded with paid crap they shove onto it that slows it down and eats up your storage space and makes things way more difficult than they need to be, until you just want to throw it away.  Google already has most of the things in their android OS base that you need.  Samsung just recreates most of them, badly.The ""Phone"" app lacks features the native android version has, the ""messages"" app tries to make it look like iMessage, and there's the ""Samsung Store"" which is pushed upon you for all sorts of things, from setting a background picture to installing more Samsung Apps you have no use for.  There's loads of features that are only available when you log the phone in to your ""Samsung Account"".  I really don't need another worthless account to log my phone into, thanks.Thankfully there's some really slick people at XDA Developers who make some programs that will allow you to disable all the bloatware and BS that comes on this phone, as I have 61 - yes, SIXTY ONE - disabled Samsung apps on this phone just to get it de-bloated and running smooth and fast, and extend the battery life to what could be considered marginal.  Without it, I was out of battery by 8pm as every Samsung app keeps trying to do something in the background all day long, draining your battery.If they had a ""Clean Install"" button that took out all the sh!t, it would make this phone a 9/10 immediately.  Further time will tell on the fold and how that holds up over time."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Great for gaming, great picture, fingerprint reader is epic, takes up little space, wallet case is awesome. Love everything about this phone but it's battery life.So I'm an average user(about 10 minutes of screen time an hour) , and even with power saver mode on, I can barely make it a full day without charging. If I take it out of battery mode, which most of us hate, I can literally be at 50% in a couple hours.I would literally give 5* if it didn't have battery problems. The phone is definitely the future, it just needs some small tweaks and a real life battery. The fold is the best protection for a screen and I drink a lot so that's really appealing."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"I did not buy this phone on Amazon but after my experience I must warn whoever I can to avoid this flip phone.After 3 weeks use indoors, the lower screen began to ‚Äúaura‚Äù. I sent it in for repair and was told that the warranty did not cover the issue so I had to pay $387 for the repair. No amount of reasoning with customer support could make them see that this was clearly a systemic issue. I should never have left iPhone."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Love this little phone.  The batter charges fast and works great with the wireless charger.  Really great to have a little phone that fits in my pocket and yet opens to a great, easy to use size."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"It's actually good, but the bottom part just keeps sliding off."
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,This phone would not access my wifi
SAMSUNG Unlocked Smartphone Intuitive Warranty,"Had my new Z3 flip 5g for less than a month screen went black, sent it back to Samsung because they wouldnt replace but said will only fix under their warranty. Email today said I would have to pay for the LCD to be replaced plus repair and tax . Total $378.86 . I traded in a working Galaxy S10e that worked great for a phone that didnt last a month. And their others just like me , just read the reviews. Some are even on Samsungs site for the phone. But their are plenty of people like me."
