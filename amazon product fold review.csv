Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I've been a Samsung phone owner for the last 14 years, ever since I got my first Galaxy Note (the very original one, can you believe it's been so long?). I've owned most of the Note line, a couple of the S line (S 8, S10+) and finally went back to the Note 10+, then to this one in December of last year.Let me say that my experience with most of the Galaxy S line of phones was pretty great. I loved having the pen option (this one includes it separately which is really stupid given the price of the phone, more on this later) and I loved having a large screen to read on. I primarily use my phone for reading, either ebooks (which is great on this device) or just scrolling through news articles. A bigger screen makes seeing all of the text much easier. It was with this in mind that I jumped over to getting my first folding phone, this one.The larger screen size when you open it up really is something special, especially with all of the new multitasking features that they recently brought to this phone. I don't use them that much, but it is nice to say, look at something and take notes at the same time and take advantage of that large real estate. Where it really matters though is for reading. I used to have a Kindle that I used as my primary reading device, but I switched over to this because the interior screen size is basically the same. It also has much better brightness controls than my 2018 Oasis, which gives of a very irritating blueish tone even with warmth set up all the way. There is no problem with that on this device since the AMOLED panel is full of self-emissive pixels and has no backlight. Samsung's screens have always been amazing, and this device certainly shows it off well.The actual fit and finish of the device are nice. I got the silver version which for some reason is called a business model (whatever) which has a slightly reflective finish to it reminiscent of the flashy white background my Note10+ had, but with a much softer, matte frosted glass look. The aluminum has withstood the daily abuse of phone ownership well, and the hinge has done a pretty good job. It's been scuffed up quite a bit unfortunately, and this has been from a variety of sources. The main problem appears to be just stuff in your pocket. Unless you have a case that covers the hinge VERY WELL and sometimes even if you do, sand and sharp pieces of dust can sometimes get stuck in the hinge leaving small scratch marks. It tends to collect scratches and dents, despite being a chunky stainless steel. For the price, it's good, I like the look of the phone.Battery life has always been a sore point for these phones because all that screen requires a lot of juice to stay lit up and you will be using it a lot. I've found myself needing to keep a charger nearby which hasn't been too bad working from home but you'll probably want to carry a power bank with you for longer trips. This guy uses battery up quick.Software is much improved over the years. OneUI, formerly TouchWiz, used to get such a bad rap from reviewers and I never really knew why. People thought it was bloated and clunky, and I never really got it. I think this new version is great, the settings are good, and Samsung's customizations are much improved!Now onto why I gave this guy such a crappy rating; the problems. For a third-generation product I expected Samsung had ironed out most of the kinks that people complained about in the first two generations. I unfortunately was wrong. I've had two major issues since I took ownership of this device almost a year ago. Fortunately, Samsung has a very generous warranty redemption policy and has fixed both issues (the first time they even provided me a free, but crappy, leather phone case) with very quick one-day shipping. I do love these policies and they are wonderful. But for a phone this expensive I was planning on keeping it for a few years, and I'm not sure I will be able to.The first issue happened about 6 months into ownership and was over the summer. I had bought a Spigen cover for it to make sure the phone was kept in a tight, very-well protected cover and never dropped it. In spite of this, the device was afflicted by a very weird issue where the front screen would not turn on at all. The middle screen would still open, but sometimes the entire device would crash when I attempted to use the front screen. Obviously a big selling point of the phone is having multiple screens to work with, so I sent it in for repair which Samsung fortunately did. A major problem that fortunately hasn't returned, although we'll see about the long term.The second issue proved just as infuriating. Before I sent this device in for repair I made mention that I was having issues with the Wi-fi in the hopes it would be repaired. It wasn't, because after it came back from being serviced it got slowly worse to the point where attempting to turn on the wifi in the settings app crashed the settings app and required a restart for it to be reopened. A quick search online has resulted in many other people complaining about similar issues with their phones, so Samsung appears to have a design flaw baked into the device causing the issue. Having wifi on a phone like this is obviously essential so as not to waste data, and to connect the device to the IOT devices in my home---a functionality that I was completely without. I sent this into Samsung for repair again and they actually sent me back a brand new device---I guess evidence that whatever the problem was, it was not something they could easily replace in the device. Hopefully this new one lasts me longer than the last!To cap this all off, and give a recommendation. Would I recommend this phone? If you can get it for a great discount, sure. It would be more worth it not paying full price. If you're paying full price, I'd say make sure to get an extended warranty because you will probably use it with this device once Samsung's protection wears off it."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I was leary of grabbing this because i am in Japan. However, someday ill move back to the states and got tired of Japanese phones (most of the apps are in Japanese, making it hard to troubleshoot problems). Happy it works."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Thanks for the Excellent Delivery in love with the product suit all my need for multitasking and working, I check."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Love the size, capabilities and effects! I got this phone for my husband birthday and he loves it."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,All the reviews are from excited box openers. Go look on the Samsung website at the hundreds of complaints about the crack developing in the fold line. Samsung are refusing to fix them under the warranty telling everyone the damage is user abuse. You should then consider every  fold sold should still be under warranty as I type. They want $520 to replace the screen. I can’t tell you how important it is to research before you buy.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I would 100% not recommend this phone it stops working after so long and to fix it cost in labor is $300 its self not including parts. The fold is the same way. Would not recommend getting any fold phones for a few years, till they can make them better"
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"At first phone felt awkward because it is heavy and think. The front screen more narrow then normal phone. But using it for couple days I became used to it. Great for when I'm on the road and my tablet or my laptop isn't available. On down time while waiting for the wife, I can kill time with watching videos or playing games."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,I love my phone it works for all my needs
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Only thing that was an issue was the inner screen protector immediately started to peel away near the center so I just removed it
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,I  use this phone for every thing I like the  double  face.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Fantastic adjustable keyboard. Beautiful large screen. Great camera and so many more features than IPhone. I have mine set up so I have a work set of apps and a separate personal set of apps. Flips easily from one to the other. Superior to the IPhone and I have both and like them both.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Samsungs fault the screen cracks on the fold inside. Crap quality. Will not buy another Samsung as they won't warranty this defect.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Screen will crack  from opening and shutting. Camera IS TERRIBLE
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I would seriously avoid buying this phone, especially on Amazon where you likelihood of claiming warranty fixes will be more difficult. I bought this phone straight from the Samsungs website on preorder, the entire period I have owned the phone it was in the case and never dropped. Slowly over time, the inner screen protector began to peal near the corners. Yesterday I slowly used my nail to push back the bubble and the entire left side panel turned a peach color and broke. A small movement like this just shows how fragile this phone is. I'm now in the process of a warranty repair, if this would have happed 2 months from now, my warranty wouldn't have covered the damage. Wish me luck that they don't try and charge me 300-500 for a repair and just give me a new phone, probably going to sell it after this, I can't deal any longer with such a fragile phone. I forgot to take a picture before sending it in, but believe me, I wouldn't make a long post like this just to say some BS."

Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,After spending a year of requesting informing samsung still samsung refuses to fix a simple software fix that is included in my 100$ a51 as most of their cheaper phones where the vidoe auto fills the screen. But on this 1800$ hunk of junk these losers refuse to address the issue which leaves majority of the screen black whether on youtube netflix any paid vidoe app or even ur personal videos. Itryed to show the customer service via smart tutor remote control but since the worst customer service ever they instead think we r stupid n lie their way to helll. Also these losers force the update icon to annoy u to update with a new software update that has no improvements but only renewal of their legal rights to contiue to sell ur infomation n violate ur privacy. If u must buy a Samsung then buy a phone that is less then 500$ as it does way more then this hunk of junk.js
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,This was supposed to be new but had a email set up for an Isiah. It was scratched and had a minor crack. So back it went
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,This Foldable is almost ready! The outside screen is very narrow so texting is quite difficult. The battery life wasn’t fantastic but that’s expected with what it’s capable of. It seemed quite durable and able to withstand what life throws at it. But the outside screen is tiny!
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Excelente como siempre lo que sea samsung
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I saw the fold phones as gimmick let downs when they first came out, never owned one, so just speculated, but thought they were just overpriced and probably not worth the investment. I finally caved after seeing all the positive reviews for this fold 3 and it is pretty awesome. Something about just folding the phone and the screen closing is kind of mesmerizing, something you just have to experience for yourself to understand. It feels really firm and has a weight to it when you do it, it doesn't feel flimsy or breakable. I've played a few games like League of Legends Wild Rift and after playing it on my Z Fold 3 I don't know how I'll ever go back. For the price point though at $1800 dollars I wouldn't say it's a phone that anyone needs at all, but if you can afford it and are someone that keeps phones 2 - 3 years instead of upgrading every single year and like the idea of it, I would say it's worth checking out. This phone defiantly excels when playing games, watching shows/movies, and multitasking. Could also be worth just having if you are the kind of person that carries around a phone and a tablet, with the Z Fold 3 you have both devices in one."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I was hesitant to buy a used phone but it was just like new!  It's a great phone, so much faster than my old S9+!  I love the big screen and use it for more than I anticipated."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,The glass will break at the fold after a few months of normal use. Samsung won't fix and claim its exterior damage. This is a folding phone that breaks when you fold it... They want $400+ to repair. Dont waste you money. If you dont mind spending 2k and 400 every few months then sure go for it.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I had huge problem getting my order delivered. UPS charged me an additional $7.99 just to go somewhere pick up my package. Frustrating situation. Updating after opening my new Samsung fold Z3, suprisingly it has a cable not compatible with USB charger and it does not have a head to charge it"
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Purchased from AT&T in Nov 2021 (Currently Apr 2022). Screen has developed 2 delamination spots, one in crease and another an inch to the right."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,I love the size and the battery life
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I have a Galaxy note 20 ultra and I bought the fold out of curiosity, I thought maybe it's a gimmick, after using it about a month I thought wow this is pretty heavy and a little bulky with the case and the s pen holder so I decided to sell the fold and went back to using the note which I live and still love so I'm very conflicted and the fact is that selling either of these is easy but u take a beating on the money u get back on a sale. If you still reading thanks and if I sound confused it's because I am but that said the fold three is really a technologically Superior phone and that said I'm back to using it over the note 20 and will continue to use it I recommend the phone it's a big investment but I think you'll enjoy it ,thanks."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Phone came in with damage box, the original Samsung seal is broken but came with additional transparent seal. No charger. Looks like someone's old phone but I hope it won't develop any issues in time to come."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Like you have a phone and iPad at the same time, and you can put both of them in your pocket! It might be too thick for ladies."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Bought zfold 3 in December 2021 and in January 2022 started losing cell signal. Cellphone won't work and Samsung, although they acknowledged and recognized this model suffers from problem, they refused to fix phone or reimburse money. $1,700 stolen from this company."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,I have never exposed my phone to water but today it accidentally fell in the tub for less than 5 seconds and my big screen went black I can hear sound but is black
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,I love it and good quality! The battery can use 3 days!
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I was very hesitant on buying this phone after reading the reviews and after having the phone for 2 months thus far I still don't regret my purchase. I traded my Galaxy note 10+ for this phone and happy.MY PROS:1-Very universal you don't need a tablet really if you have this phone.2-Multiple screens you can customize 4 different wallpapers if you would like.3-You can customize pictures for each individual contact which is cool!4-Screen is very fast and sensitive to touch.5-Having the small screen when having quick use is great I like being able to quickly glance.6-Fits in your hand nicely, I hold with confidence and feel as I have a good grip when carrying phone.7-The camera is suss! I love it seems better then my husbands I-phone to be honest. The camera is best when open and taking pictures seems to have better quality.8-The screen is great for gaming and watching videos.9-Thumbprint scanner is the best I have had on ANY phone owned! It never fails like my Galaxy note did.MY CONS!!****--->1- I HATE THE BUILT IN SCREEN PROTECTOR! I am a OCD freak okay? On the regular Im used to replacing my screen protecter twice a year as I hate tiny marks. I have 2 superficial scratches on the front screen because of just holding my phone and my wedding ring touching it and one from just holding my keys in the same hand as my phone. I can't even put this into my pocket, I must be very extremely careful! I don't see why they thought having a screen protecter already on it was a good idea. HUGE con for me! I haven't had issues of the protecter coming off the sides as of yet. But if your rough with your phones and unable to baby it as I do, think about it or get the front protector case.2-The screen is a dust magnet as reviewed.3-I am bummed that most stylists aren't able to be used as I saw they can ruin the screen. the stylists I've seen that are approved are very expensive and I am worried it will ruin the phone, so haven't bought as of yet.4-Battery life last longer when using the front screen but the fullscreen is a battery drainer!5-When holding the big screen, it's a bit awkward to hold and I have almost dropped it on my face while holding it and my arms get tired.REVIEWS I SAW & My Experience:1-I saw that people had issues with their trade-ins and or getting a discount, for me I was sure too save the receipt when dropping off at the store and made sure to cut the paper in half and include the portion needed inside the box as well as save my copy. (I did take pictures of the boxing process just incase I needed proof later.) I got an email saying they received it, then an email saying they confirmed they had my phone and they would let me know if it was approved, then an email saying they would apply the whole discount and I was good.2-There is a crease where the phone folds on inside, I knew this was going to be there when I got the phone so to me this wasn't a con. I am very careful not to touch the crease as much as possible and do baby it as I saw reviews of people loosing the screen in the middle to black lines. (I will update my review if this changes but thus far its great no issues)3-It IS MOST DEFIANTLY a dust magnet as reviewed, any loose particles around gravitate to it I am constantly wiping it off.4-The battery doesn't compare to my galaxy note 10+ It does wear battery down significantly. However: I sprung for the $50 wireless charger for this phone and use that in my car mount and I haven't had it die on me I just keep topped off when a charger is nearby.5-I saw reviews that the front screen is hard to type? I personally use the Google keyboard in settings and it works pretty well when typing. I am a clumsy typer as is and don't notice much of a difference. I suppose if you had ""Phaty"" Fingers it could be tricky to type. But the big screen is great.5-I saw reviews of the screen protector it came with peeling up, I haven't noticed this myself YET but it is very extremely sensitive! and will ding at the smaller pressure.6-I saw reviews off connection issues with wired chargers? for me I got a wireless charger included with my phone so I don't use a chord very often. BUT when I do use a chord it I have no issues and try to be careful when plugging in to be extra careful.I'm sure theres other reviewed comments I should include but can't remember anymore off hand and my review is already too long lol. biggest love is the universal aspect of this phone and my cons is the built in screen protector I wish the company would replace the protector for free or stop putting one on when selling it, shouldn't be a lifetime use thing.I will update my review if anything changes."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,decent prize and the item arrive faster than expected in perfect condition
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,I had enough of apple and decided to give the Samsung fold 3 a try. I needed the larger screen for business purposes.This turned out to worst decision of my life ... whilst emails do work with my business email - contacts will not  transfer - it seems like Samsung is blocking it - so no messaging or contacts for phone - this is my livelihood and I have nothing. What's really bad is there's no technical support - no one wants help.End result I'm still using iPhone 7 still trying to do business and this device is a heap of junk
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,2000$ pile of trash screen will brake samsung will not fix as they out of screens as tons coming back for repair
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I like the phone. However, I thought it should have a pen with it which I didn't receive."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"My first day using the new phone I like it a lot ,with high quality pictures and huge screen"
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"Never going back to old boring smart phones, don't get me wrong yes this is expensive but if you really think about it, you're getting the best Snapdragon CPU on the market, 12GB of RAM and an amazing AMOLED display that runs at 120Hz in both a tablet and a phone, so for me it's the well worth the money! Never had any heat issues with it"
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Battery life is fine for me especially since it charges in just an hour with fast charging cable. Beautiful 120hz screen. Haven't had any problems with overheating. Still wish it had a headphone jack and micro sd slot but many new phones don't.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I have been using this for less than a week, and it is already developing cracks at the fold. This is a known issue with the folds, and I guess this one is no different. Disappointing because the rest of the phone is great."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Theres crack on the side and it doesnt look brand new. Looks refurbished.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Except for the foldable feature. nothing worth the money. heats like blast furnace in 30 mins. hangs in between. pictures dont load up in the gallery.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Ive had this phone 28 days before the folding glass had a malfunction. Considering I'm still paying off this phone through AT&T, so I have a very passionate opinion. This is a flagship phone with unreal specs. But that doesn't matter if the OS can't take advantage of it. The screen sensor isn't very sensitive even after adjustment. It has a tendency to freeze if youre playing PUBG. The cameras suck, specifically low light. The video I uploaded shows a manufacturer error. There is a grouping of dead pixels EXACTLY where the glass folds. And entire rows of said pixels are now dead running at 90 degrees. And they run right through the front camera and this is the resulting image. I've reached out to Samsung to fix it. I live in Connecticut. One of the most densely populated states in the US. SAMSUNG CONTRACTS ALL REPAIRS IN MY AREA TO A SINGLE THIRD PARTY CALLED ""UBREAKIFIX"". That's exactly how it's spelled. The icing on the cake? They don't fix the Fold 3 under warranty. They want me to go to New York City. A State away. OR turn over my phone for 30 days. Who in the world, in 2021 would surrender their phone for a full month. I don't know my own mother's number without my phone. That's the world we live in. A digital one. And Sumsung in their wisdom will only fix a common defect (look at the forums) if I go without my phone until Christmas. I can't return the POS. They only accept returns for 14 days after purchase. They also don't make any decent cases so, you WILL drop and break it. They're not using the same Gorilla Glass as Apple. I'll be happy to take this review down once Samsung gives me a proper working phone, since I spent $2000 on this through AT&T after taxes.Edit: I've gone through 4 of these in the last year.... I had to turn my AT&T account into a buisness line to get Exsperion to cover the fixes. 4 phones. $1000 extra to keep a phone I don't want anymore. Every single one had the center crease go dead, then the right half would stop sensing my finger. You've been warned. I either have the worst luck with 4 phones all with the same defect, in less than a year- OR ITS  A GOOD IDEA BUT A BAD DESIGN...."
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,One of the best smartphones you could buy.It's more of a phone/mini-tablet hybrid.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Inner screen cracked when opening phone. Samsung wants $500 plus to fix buyer beware!!
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,My Ultra phones are larger! Refund me! YOU'VE ALREADY RECEIVED IT! Please!
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Had my phone for about 3 weeks now. Its my first time using the DeX app and I'm very impressed with how easy it is to transfer data back and forth between my Fold3 and laptop. A lot of games are already optimized for working on the bigger screen and it really elevates my enjoyment with the kindle app. Super happy with the camera and display resolution. The front display almost feels like I'm using a thicker S20. The split screen feature is fun. makes comparison shopping easier and tracking down items you see on social media a little faster to find. The hinge area of the screen is barely noticeable as well. I do see the battery took a noticeable hit from what I'm used to with my S21 but I'm willing to work around that. It is difficult finding a decent case for it so far as it is an investment and the early cases all have a flimsy feel to them eventually time will take care of that.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,Though expensive but the features justify the cost.
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"I purchased directly from Samsung, The phone itself is a nice refinement on the z fold 2, but can you believe that for nearly2k with taxes, you get a single physical sim slot and are screwed over in having a dual sim even if you plonk down for the unlocked version.Just awful awful to their customers.  Will dump on some happy child in my family and choose between pixel 6 and iPhone 13 pro max"
Samsung Electronics Unlocked Smartphone Foldable,"The phone is good overall,  but I like to point out some flaws. The phone is hot! Yeah Im mean when i play games like Pubg and League, the phone runs really hot on my hands.  The battery is also on the lower side, 3 hours game play time is all i got . And by the way Amazon marked this phone non returnable which is odd because even the official website of Samsung allow people to try out the phone 21 days. MAKE NO SENSE."
